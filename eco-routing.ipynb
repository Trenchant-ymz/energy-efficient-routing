    "2. Selecting the most energy-efficient path for that vehicle.(Well-done, A*-similar algorithm)\n",

    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the mass influence the energy efficient path?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How can we find the energy efficient path which is not in OBD data?\n",

    "For a certain path, clustering trajectories of this path into *k* scenarios according to the estimation of their *EAIR* and *MP*. Then, we predict the scenario and the *VP* for a truck  based on ***its historical data***, and we can use the equation to calculate the enengy consumption. For a union path, a scenario on $P_i$ is similar to a scenario on $P_{i+1}$ when the enengy consumption reprsented by the two scenarios' signature functions are similar on the shared road segments.\n",

    "2. We need to know the energy consumption of the first two road segments. What if we donot know it? How can we predict the parameters in this case?"
